# Docker Nginx PHP-FPM

This repository contains the necessary files to build and run a Docker container for your application. The following files are included:

## Files

### `compose.yaml`

This file is used by Docker Compose to define and run the application's services. It specifies the configuration for each service, such as the Docker image to use, environment variables, volumes, and more.

### `Dockerfile`

The Dockerfile contains instructions for building the Docker image for your application. It specifies the base image, installs dependencies, copies the application code, and sets the entry point for the container.

### `config.yml`

This file contains configuration settings for your application. You can modify this file to adjust various settings as per your requirements.

### `custom-entrypoint.sh`

This is a custom script that will be executed when the container starts. You can modify this script to perform any additional setup or initialization tasks required by your application.

### `sample.xconf`

This is a sample configuration file specific to your application. You can use this as a reference or modify it as needed.

## Usage

1. **Build the Docker image:**

   ```bash
   docker build -t my-app .

2. **Run the Docker container:**
   ```bash
   docker run -p 8080:80 my-app
This command will start the container and map the host's port 8080 to the container's port 80.

3. **Use Docker Compose (optional):** If you prefer to use Docker Compose, you can run the following command:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up
This will start the services defined in the compose.yaml file.

## Customization
